  Abstract                 = {The article focuses on gradience in linguistics and philosophy. It argues that gradience should have a role to play in language studies. It shows that two types of category fluidity should be distinguished. One type is called Subsective Gradience (SG). It is intra-categorial in nature, and allows for members of a class to display the properties of that class to varying degrees. The other type is called Intersective Gradience (IG). This is an inter-categorial phenomenon which is characterised by two form classes converging on each other. It also argues that while the two types of gradience are grammatically real, IG is not as widespread as is often claimed. The article attempts to be more precise about the vague phenomenon of gradience. },

  Abstract                 = {As listeners and readers, we rarely notice the ambiguities that pervade our everyday
language. When we hear the proverb ‘Time flies like an arrow’ we might ponder its
meaning, but not the fact that there are almost 100 grammatically permissible
interpretations of this short sentence. On occasion, however, we do notice sentential
ambiguity: headlines, such as ‘Two Sisters Reunited After 18 Years in Checkout
Counter’, are amusing because they so consistently lead to the unintended
interpretation (presumably, the sisters did not spend 18 years at the checkout). It is this
consistent preference for one interpretation – and one grammatical structure – rather
than another that has fuelled research into sentence processing for more than 20 years.
Until relatively recently, the dominant belief had been that these preferences arise
from general principles that underlie our use of grammar, with certain grammatical
constructions being preferred over others. There has now accrued, however, a
considerable body of evidence demonstrating that these preferences are not absolute,
but can change in particular circumstances. With this evidence have come new theories
of sentence processing, some of which, at first glance, radically question the standard
notions of linguistic representation, grammar and understanding.},

  Abstract                 = {English idioms commonly appear to exhibit relatively fixed prosodic patterns, and departure from the expected prosodic pattern can give rise to humorous and bizarre effects. As idioms are generally supposed to require phrasal entries in the mental lexicon, there is some initial plausibility in the proposal that such entries might include arbitrary prosodic or accentual properties. Various categories of idiom can be distinguished, according to which aspects of the prosodic pattern seem to be fixed, and the relationship the pattern bears to those which would be expected on corresponding literal expressions. Nevertheless it is argued that the prosodic patterns of idioms are in reality neither fixed nor arbitrary. The bizarre effects in interpretation result not from deviation from a lexically specified pattern, but from the attempt to introduce focus distinctions into the non-compositional parts of idioms. Implications for psycholinguistic studies of the processing of ambiguous sentences are discussed.},

argue that they always adjoin to non-arguments (in recent terms this means that they can
adjoin to VPs, IPs, APs and root CPs, but never to argument DPs or argument CPs), and that
they do not undergo LF raising. Presenting a range of mostly new data and observations, we
show how this theory accounts for a variety of puzzling distributional facts about adverbial
and ad-adjectival particles, in particular, their specific interpretations and their behavior
with respect to scope and reconstruction.},

  Abstract                 = {The neural bases of prosody during the production of literal and idiomatic interpretations of literally plausible idioms was investigated. Left- and right-hemisphere-damaged participants and normal controls produced literal and idiomatic versions of idioms (He hit the books.) All groups modulated duration to distinguish the interpretations. LHD patients, however, showed typical speech timing difficulties. RHD patients did not differ from the normal controls. The results partially support a differential lateralization of prosodic cues in the two cerebral hemispheres [Van Lancker, D., & Sidtis, J. J. (1992). The identification of affective-prosodic stimuli by left- and right-hemisphere-damaged subjects: All errors are not created equal. Journal of Speech and Hearing Research, 35, 963-970]. Furthermore, extended final word lengthening appears to mark idiomaticity.},

The present magnetencephalographic (MEG) study explored whether this subset of [`]light' verbs is represented in distinct cortical processes. A random sequence of German [`]heavy', [`]light', and pseudo verbs was visually presented in three runs to 22 native German speakers, who performed lexical decision task on real versus pseudo verbs. Across runs, verbs were presented (a) in isolation, (b) in minimal context of a personal pronoun, and (c) [`]light' verbs only in a disambiguating context sentence. Central posterior activity 95-135 ms after stimulus onset was more pronounced for [`]heavy' than for [`]light' uses, whether presented in isolation or in minimal context. Minimal context produced a similar heavy > light differentiation in the left visual word form area at 160-200 ms. [`]Light' verbs presented in sentence context allowing only for a [`]heavy reading' evoked larger left-temporal activation around 270-340 ms than the corresponding [`]light reading'. Across runs, real verbs provoked more pronounced activation than pseudo verbs in left-occipital regions at 110-150 ms. Thus, [`]heavy' versus [`]light readings' of verbs already modulate early posterior visual evoked response even when verbs are presented in isolation. This response becomes clearer in the disambiguating contextual condition. This type of study shows for the first time that language processing is sensitive to representational differences between two readings of one and the same verb stem.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT It is not unusual for developmental psychologists to become frustrated with the theory of universal grammar (UG), whose proponents have tended to dismiss most research on children&apos;s language production and comprehension as irrelevant to explaining how human languages are acquired. This is because children&apos;s actual linguistic behaviour is presumed to reflect factors besides their grammatical competence, rendering most methods of sampling linguistic behaviour unsuitable for evaluating UG theory. This means, in practice, that UG proponents do not view performance errors as evidence against their hypothesis that grammatical knowledge is largely innate. When children perform at ceiling on a given task, this is usually taken as proof of their adultlike grammatical competence, while poor performance is dismissed as due to research design flaws or limitations in information processing capacities (e.g. working memory). Crain &amp; Thornton (1998) attempt to eliminate what they consider to be post hoc processing accounts of children&apos;s linguistic behaviour by arguing, counter to Chomsky (1965) and many others, that children and adults share identical language processing mechanisms, and that linguistic performance directly reflects grammatical competence. Therefore, if UG principles are available from an early age, child and adult performance should be the same when tasks are properly constructed to avoid extra-linguistic demand characteristics (excepting adult&ndash;child differences predicted by parameter-setting or maturational models). It should not be surprising then that some psycholinguists, such as Drozd (target article), would find C&amp;T to be misguided with respect to these issues, because children&apos;s linguistic behaviour surely differs from adults&apos; in seemingly unpredictable ways. }

The good and poor comprehenders did not differ in their abilities to interpret transparent idioms in context, but the poor comprehenders were significantly worse at using context to work out the meanings of opaque idioms. The explanation task revealed the source of information used by the children to derive nontarget interpretations.

We used a multiple-choice task and manipulated whether the idioms were transparent or opaque, familiar or novel, and presented with or without a supportive story context. Performance was compared with that of adults (Experiment 1) and 11- and 12-year-olds (Experiment 2). The results broadly support Cacciari and Levorato's global elaboration model of figurative competence with a notable exception: Even the youngest children were able to use semantic analysis to derive the meanings of transparent idioms as well as being sensitive to meaning in context. The findings show that young children process language at both the small-grain phrase level and the discourse level to establish figurative meaning, and they demonstrate that the language processing skills that aid idiom comprehension, as well as idiom knowledge itself, are still not fully developed in 11- and 12-year-olds.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we study the acquisition of German noun plurals in relation to the
question of how children represent regular and irregular inflection. Pinker and
Prince (1992) have demonstrated several dissociations between regular and irregular
inflection in the English past tense system. However, in English, the default
status of -ed is confounded with its high frequency; therefore inflectional systems
other than English past tense formation must be examined. The noun plural system
in German is particularly interesting, because most nouns have irregular plurals in
German and the regular (default) plural is less frequent than several of the irregular
plurals. Thus it is unclear how a language learner determines whether German even
has a regular plural, and if so what form it takes. Based on longitudinal data from
impaired and unimpaired monolingual German-speaking children, we find a
striking, statistically significant correlation: plural affixes that are used in overregularizations,
namely -n or -s, are left out within compounds. This correlation shows},

The meanings are best accounted for by a theory of interpretation that specifies what the verbs mean on particular occasions of their use. Our proposal is that their use is regulated by a convention: in using such a verb, the speaker means to denote the kind of state, event, or process that, he has good reason to believe, the listener can readily and uniquely compute on this occasion, on the basis of their mutual knowledge, in such a way that the parent noun (e.g. porch or Houdini) denotes one role in the state, event, or process, and the remaining surface arguments of the denominal verb denote others of its roles. This convention accounts for the meaning and acceptability of innovative verbs in various contexts; similar conventions may be needed to account for other innovative uses of language.},

disambiguating material were manipulated. Evidence of disruption was found in temporarily ambiguous sentences,
regardless of animacy or preview. In the second experiment, readers with high versus low verbal working memory
capacity read the sentences from Experiment 1. High and low-span readers exhibited very similar patterns of processing.
As in the first experiment, evidence for disruption was found in temporarily ambiguous sentences whether the sentential
subject was animate or inanimate. Sentences with animate subjects were hard to interpret, and relatively late measures
of processing indicated that an animate subject made ambiguity especially hard to overcome. We interpret the findings
as being consistent with serial, depth-first models of parsing.},

  Abstract                 = {An event-related brain potential (ERP) reflecting the acoustic-phonetic process in the phonological stage of word processing was recorded to the terminal words of spoken sentences. The peak latency of this negative-going response occurred between 270 and 300 msec after the onset of the terminal word. The independence of this response (the phonological mismatch negativity, PMN) from the ERP component known to be sensitive to semantic violations (N400) was demonstrated by manipulating sentence endings so that phonemic and semantic violations occurred together or separately. Four conditions used sentences that ended with (1) the highest Cloze probability word (e.g., 'The piano was out of tune.'), (2) a word having the same initial phoneme of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically anomalous (e.g., 'The gambler had a streak of bad luggage.'), (3) a word having an initial phoneme different from that of the highest Cloze probability word but that was, in fact, semantically appropriate (e.g., 'Don caught the ball with his glove.'), or (4) a word that was semantically anomalous and, therefore, had an initial phoneme that was totally unexpected given the sentence's context (e.g., 'The dog chased our cat up the queen.'). Neither the PMN nor the N400 was found in the first condition. Only an N400 was observed in the second condition while only a PMN was seen in the third. Both responses were elicited in the last condition. Finally, a delayed N400 occurred to semantic violations in the second condition where the initial phoneme was identical to that of the highest Cloze probability ending. Results are discussed with regard to the Cohort model of word recognition.},

We sketch the Simpler Syntax Hypothesis, which holds that much of the explanatory role attributed to syntax in contemporary linguistics is properly the responsibility of semantics. This rebalancing permits broader coverage of empirical linguistic phenomena and promises a tighter integration of linguistic theory into the cognitive scientific enterprise. We suggest that the general perspective of the Simpler Syntax Hypothesis is well suited to approaching language processing and language evolution, and to computational applications that draw upon linguistic insights.},

However, in a similar task designed to elicit the production of nouns, both patients performed quite defectively, and their scores were many SDs below those of controls. Language processing was otherwise normal--i.e., there were no impairments in grammar, morphology, phonetic implementation, or prosody; reading and writing were normal. In a third patient (KJ-1360), we obtained the reverse outcome--i.e., retrieval of common and proper nouns was preserved, but verb retrieval was defective. Together, the findings in the three patients constitute a double dissociation between noun and verb retrieval. In AN-1033 and Boswell, the lesions are located outside the so-called language areas (left frontoparietal operculum, posterior temporal region, inferior parietal lobule), where damage is associated with aphasia. The region of damage shared by the two patients is in left anterior and middle temporal lobe. This sector of left hemisphere contains systems for the retrieval of nouns that denote concrete entities. We propose that those systems are not essential for the retrieval of verbs and not involved in the vocal implementation of word forms. Those systems perform a two-way lexical-mediation role for concrete nouns and promote the reconstruction of a word form after the processing of sensory-motor characteristics of the entity denoted by that word. The findings in patient KJ-1360, whose lesion is in left premotor cortex, suggest that equivalent mediation systems for verbs are located in the left frontal region.}

Here we exploited a phonological regularity of English indefinite articles ('an' precedes nouns beginning with vowel sounds, whereas 'a' precedes nouns beginning with consonant sounds) in combination with event-related brain potential recordings from the human scalp to show that readers' brains can pre-activate individual words in a graded fashion to a degree that can be estimated from the probability that each word is given as a continuation for a sentence fragment offline. These findings are evidence that readers use the words in a sentence (as cues to their world knowledge) to estimate relative likelihoods for upcoming words. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT This article shows how language processing is intimately tuned to input frequency. Examples are given of frequency effects in the processing of phonology, phonotactics, reading, spelling, lexis, morphosyntax, formulaic language, language comprehension, grammaticality, sentence production, and syntax. The implications of these effects for the representations and developmental sequence of SLA are discussed. Usage-based theories hold that the acquisition of language is exemplar based. It is the piecemeal learning of many thousands of constructions and the frequency-biased abstraction of regularities within them. Determinants of pattern productivity include the power law of practice, cue competition and constraint satisfaction, connectionist learning, and effects of type and token frequency. The regularities of language emerge from experience as categories and prototypical patterns. The typical route of emergence of constructions is from formula, through low-scope pattern, to construction. Frequency plays a large part in explaining sociolinguistic variation and language change. Learners&apos; sensitivity to frequency in all these domains has implications for theories of implicit and explicit learning and their interactions. The review concludes by considering the history of frequency as an explanatory concept in theoretical and applied linguistics, its 40 years of exile, and its necessary reinstatement as a bridging variable that binds the different schools of language acquisition research. }

When interpreting new verbs describing the same motion events, children who heard transitive sentences were more likely than were children who heard intransitive sentences to assume that the verb referred to the actions of the causal agent. The sentences were designed so that only the number of noun-phrase arguments differed across conditions (e.g. She's pilking her over there versus She's pilking over there). These experiments isolate number of noun-phrase arguments (or number of nouns) as an early constraint on sentence interpretation and verb learning, and provide strong evidence that children as young as 2.5 years of age attend to a sentence's overall structure in interpreting it.},

  Abstract                 = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff's critique, we extend our previous framework for discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and evolution of language requires fractionation of "language" into component mechanisms and interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not "language" as a whole. Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and Jackendoff's emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data. Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

We found that the word orders speakers used in their everyday speech did not influence their nonverbal behavior. Surprisingly, speakers of all four languages used the same order and on both nonverbal tasks. This order, actor–patient–act, is analogous to the subject–object–verb pattern found in many languages of the world and, importantly, in newly developing gestural languages. The findings provide evidence for a natural order that we impose on events when describing and reconstructing them nonverbally and exploit when constructing language anew.}

We describe the salient characteristics of functionalist, cognitivist and/or constructionist models against the general background of usage-based models, and also include in our discussion the parallel architecture framework of Jackendoff (1997, 2002a, 2002b), recently further refined as the Simpler Syntax hypothesis (Culicover & Jackendoff, 2005). A list of 36 features for the comparison of models is drawn up, and each of 11 approaches is discussed in the light of these features. Our conclusion is that although the study provides some evidence for the view that functionalist and cognitive and/or constructionist models occupy two partially distinct areas of functional/cognitive space, there is nevertheless a large group of features which are shared across all the types of model we have examined. Other groups of features allow us to distinguish between two major},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces an extension of distinctive-collocate analysis that takes
into account grammatical structure and is specifically geared to investigating
pairs of semantically similar grammatical constructions and the lexemes that
occur in them. The method, referred to as ‘distinctive-collexeme analysis’,
identifies lexemes that exhibit a strong preference for one member of the pair
as opposed to the other, and thus makes it possible to identify subtle
distributional differences between the members of such a pair. The method
can be applied in the context of what is sometimes referred to as ‘grammatical
alternation’ (e.g. the dative alternation), but it can also be applied to other
choices provided by the grammar (such as the two future tense constructions
in English). The method has two main applications. First, it can reveal subtle
differences between seemingly synonymous constructions, many of which are
difficult to identify on the basis of more traditional approaches. Second, it
can be used to investigate the very notion of ‘alternation’; we show that many
alternations are much more restricted than has hitherto been assumed, and
thus confirm the claims of recent, non-derivational views of grammar.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract: A new view of the functional role of the left anterior cortex in language use is proposed. The experimental record indicates
that most human linguistic abilities are not localized in this region. In particular, most of syntax (long thought to be there) is not located
in Broca’s area and its vicinity (operculum, insula, and subjacent white matter). This cerebral region, implicated in Broca’s aphasia, does
have a role in syntactic processing, but a highly specific one: It is the neural home to receptive mechanisms involved in the computation
of the relation between transformationally moved phrasal constituents and their extraction sites (in line with the Trace-Deletion Hy-
pothesis). It is also involved in the construction of higher parts of the syntactic tree in speech production. By contrast, basic combinato-
rial capacities necessary for language processing – for example, structure-building operations, lexical insertion – are not supported by
the neural tissue of this cerebral region, nor is lexical or combinatorial semantics.
The dense body of empirical evidence supporting this restrictive view comes mainly from several angles on lesion studies of syntax in
agrammatic Broca’s aphasia. Five empirical arguments are presented: experiments in sentence comprehension, cross-linguistic consid-
erations (where aphasia findings from several language types are pooled and scrutinized comparatively), grammaticality and plausibility
judgments, real-time processing of complex sentences, and rehabilitation. Also discussed are recent results from functional neuroimag-
ing and from structured observations on speech production of Broca’s aphasics.
Syntactic abilities are nonetheless distinct from other cognitive skills and are represented entirely and exclusively in the left cerebral
hemisphere. Although more widespread in the left hemisphere than previously thought, they are clearly distinct from other human com-
binatorial and intellectual abilities. The neurological record (based on functional imaging, split-brain and right-hemisphere-damaged
patients, as well as patients suffering from a breakdown of mathematical skills) indicates that language is a distinct, modularly organized
neurological entity. Combinatorial aspects of the language faculty reside in the human left cerebral hemisphere, but only the transfor-
mational component (or algorithms that implement it in use) is located in and around Broca’s area.},

  Abstract                 = {A central and in?uential idea among researchers of language is that our language faculty is organized
according to Fregean compositionality, which states that the meaning of an utterance is a function of
the meaning of its parts and of the syntactic rules by which these parts are combined. Since the
domain of syntactic rules is the sentence, the implication of this idea is that language interpretation
takes place in a two-step fashion. First, the meaning of a sentence is computed. In a second step, the
sentence meaning is integrated with information from prior discourse, world knowledge, information
about the speaker and semantic information from extra-linguistic domains such as co-speech gestures
or the visual world. Here, we present results from recordings of event-related brain potentials that are
inconsistent with this classical two-step model of language interpretation. Our data support a one-
step model in which knowledge about the context and the world, concomitant information from
other modalities, and the speaker are brought to bear immediately, by the same fast-acting brain
system that combines the meanings of individual words into a message-level representation.
Underlying the one-step model is the immediacy assumption, according to which all available
information will immediately be used to co-determine the interpretation of the speaker’s message.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging data that we collected indicate that Broca’s area plays an
important role in semantic uni?cation. Language comprehension involves the rapid incorporation of
information in a ‘single uni?cation space’, coming from a broader range of cognitive domains than
presupposed in the standard two-step model of interpretation.},

  Abstract                 = {In this response to Pinker and Jackendoff’s critique, we extend our previous framework for
discussion of language evolution, clarifying certain distinctions and elaborating on a number of
points. In the first half of the paper, we reiterate that profitable research into the biology and
evolution of language requires fractionation of “language” into component mechanisms and
interfaces, a non-trivial endeavor whose results are unlikely to map onto traditional disciplinary
boundaries. Our terminological distinction between FLN and FLB is intended to help clarify
misunderstandings and aid interdisciplinary rapprochement. By blurring this distinction, Pinker and
Jackendoff mischaracterize our hypothesis 3 which concerns only FLN, not “language” as a whole.
Many of their arguments and examples are thus irrelevant to this hypothesis. Their critique of the
minimalist program is for the most part equally irrelevant, because very few of the arguments in our
original paper were tied to this program; in an online appendix we detail the deep inaccuracies in
their characterization of this program. Concerning evolution, we believe that Pinker and
Jackendoff’s emphasis on the past adaptive history of the language faculty is misplaced. Such
questions are unlikely to be resolved empirically due to a lack of relevant data, and invite speculation
rather than research. Preoccupation with the issue has retarded progress in the field by diverting
research away from empirical questions, many of which can be addressed with comparative data.
Moreover, offering an adaptive hypothesis as an alternative to our hypothesis concerning
mechanisms is a logical error, as questions of function are independent of those concerning
mechanism. The second half of our paper consists of a detailed response to the specific data
discussed by Pinker and Jackendoff. Although many of their examples are irrelevant to our original
paper and arguments, we find several areas of substantive disagreement that could be resolved by
future empirical research. We conclude that progress in understanding the evolution of language will
require much more empirical research, grounded in modern comparative biology, more
interdisciplinary collaboration, and much less of the adaptive storytelling and phylogenetic
speculation that has traditionally characterized the field.},

  Abstract                 = {This article sketches the Parallel Architecture, an approach to the structure of grammar that contrasts with mainstream generative grammar (MGG) in that (a) it treats phonology, syntax, and semantics as independent generative components whose structures are linked by interface rules; (b) it uses a parallel constraint-based formalism that is nondirectional; (c) it treats words and rules alike as pieces of linguistic structure stored in long-term memory. In addition to the theoretical advantages offered by the Parallel Architecture, it lends itself to a direct interpretation in processing terms, in which pieces of structure stored in long-term memory are assembled in working memory, and alternative structures are in competition. The resulting model of processing is compared both with processing models derived from MGG and with lexically driven connectionist architectures.},

The crucial problem is to develop a notion of lexical redundancy rules which permits an adequate description of the partial relations and idiosyncrasy characteristic of the lexicon. Two lexicalist theories of redundancy rules, each equipped with an evaluation measure, are compared on the basis of their accounts of nominalizations; the superior one, the FULL-ENTRY THEORY, is then applied to a range of further well-known examples such as causative verbs, nominal compounds, and idioms.},

  Abstract                 = { ABSTRACT The sequence make the claim that S has certain syntactic properties which indicate the presence of some sort of complex predicate, previously suggested to be a Light Verb Construction (LVC) or a reanalysis of N and V to a complex V. I consider and reject both these proposals, and propose an alternative structure which is still a type of complex predicate. Adopting the Locality framework of Manzini (1992, 1994), I show that a syntactic account of extractions from make the claim follows straightforwardly. I also show that extraction from make the claim is distinct from extraction from indefinites. }

  Abstract                 = {In 1980, the N400 event-related potential was described in association with semantic
anomalies within sentences. When, in 1992, a second waveform, the P600, was reported in
association with syntactic anomalies and ambiguities, the story appeared to be complete:
the brain respected a distinction between semantic and syntactic representation and
processes. Subsequent studies showed that the P600 to syntactic anomalies and ambiguities
was modulated by lexical and discourse factors. Most surprisingly, more than a decade after
the P600 was first described, a series of studies reported that semantic verb–argument
violations, in the absence of any violations or ambiguities of syntax can evoke robust P600
effects and no N400 effects. These observations have raised fundamental questions about
the relationship between semantic and syntactic processing in the brain. This paper
provides a comprehensive review of the recent studies that have demonstrated P600s to
semantic violations in light of several proposed triggers: semantic–thematic attraction,
semantic associative relationships, animacy and semantic-thematic violations, plausibility,
task, and context. I then discuss these findings in relation to a unifying theory that attempts
to bring some of these factors together and to link the P600 produced by semantic verb–
argument violations with the P600 evoked by unambiguous syntactic violations and
syntactic ambiguities. I suggest that normal language comprehension proceeds along at
least two competing neural processing streams: a semantic memory-based mechanism, and
a combinatorial mechanism (or mechanisms) that assigns structure to a sentence primarily
on the basis of morphosyntactic rules, but also on the basis of certain semantic–thematic
constraints. I suggest that conflicts between the different representations that are output by
these distinct but interactive streams lead to a continued combinatorial analysis that is
reflected by the P600 effect. I discuss some of the implications of this non-syntactocentric,
dynamic model of language processing for understanding individual differences, language
processing disorders and the neuroanatomical circuitry engaged during language
comprehension. Finally, I suggest that that these two processing streams may generalize
beyond the language system to real-world visual event comprehension.},

  Abstract                 = {Event-related potentials were measured as subjects read sentences presented
word by word. A small N400 and a robust P600 effect were elicited by verbs
that assigned the thematic role of Agent to their preceding noun-phrase
argument when this argument was inanimate in nature. The amplitude of the
P600, but not the N400, was modulated by the transitivity of the critical verbs
and by plausibility ratings of passivised versions of these sentences (reflecting
the fit between the critical verb and the inanimate noun-phrase as the verb’s
Theme). The P600 was similar in scalp distribution although smaller in
amplitude, than that elicited by verbs with morphosyntactic violations.
Pragmatically unlikely verbs that did not violate thematic constraints elicited
a larger N400 but no P600 effect. These findings support the theory that the
cost of syntactic processing on a verb is influenced by the precise thematic
relationships between that verb and its preceding arguments.},

  Abstract                 = {This study looks at children's comprehension of idiomatic expressions and metapragmatic knowledge. Idiomatic expressions are expressions where there is a considerable difference between what is said (literal interpretation) and what is meant (idiomatic interpretation). In other words, the meaning of an idiomatic expression depends largely on a convention that relates a given linguistic form to a given meaning. Using this framework, the present study aims to determine the role of contextual characteristics and the linguistic convention (i.e. the arbitrary link between literal meaning and the non-literal meaning) in the comprehension of idiomatic expressions by 6- and 9-year-old children, and by an adult control group. Subjects performed a story completion task (comprehension task), and a task of metapragmatic knowledge to justify their chosen answers. Two features of the stories were varied: the context (idiomatic vs. literal) and the idiom familiarity level (familiar vs. unfamiliar). The main results can be summarized as follows : (1) Regardless of age, the context had a substantial impact on idiom comprehension; (2) Linguistic convention had an effect at 9 but not at 6, and was particularly strong in adults; (3) The role of familiarity also appeared in the 9-year-olds and continued on into adulthood; (4) Metapragmatic knowledge varied with the characteristics of the communicative situation, and the content of these responses changed with age: there was a progressive increase in metapragmatic knowledge of linguistic convention as age increased.},

  Abstract                 = {Using three idiom characteristics (familiarity, literality, and compositionality), an idiom-processing model is advanced and applied to an advertising setting. Specifically, we propose that idioms of varying characteristics lead to one of six processing outcomes that can be differentiated based on processing time and comprehension. Further, we posit that consumers will exhibit different recall and attitude responses for advertisements using different types of idioms. Results from two studies provide some preliminary support for these predictions. Implications of the proposed framework for idiom research as well as for marketing theory and practice are discussed, and future research directions suggested.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies suggest common neural substrates involved in verbal and visual working memory (WM), interpreted as reflecting shared attention-based, short-term retention mechanisms. We used a machine-learning approach to determine more directly the extent to which common neural patterns characterize retention in verbal WM and visual WM. Verbal WM was assessed via a standard delayed probe recognition task for letter sequences of variable length. Visual WM was assessed via a visual array WM task involving the maintenance of variable amounts of visual information in the focus of attention. We trained a classifier to distinguish neural activation patterns associated with high- and low-visual WM load and tested the ability of this classifier to predict verbal WM load (high–low) from their associated neural activation patterns, and vice versa. We observed significant between-task prediction of load effects during WM maintenance, in posterior parietal and superior frontal regions of the dorsal attention network; in contrast, between-task prediction in sensory processing cortices was restricted to the encoding stage. Furthermore, between-task prediction of load effects was strongest in those participants presenting the highest capacity for the visual WM task. This study provides novel evidence for common, attention-based neural patterns supporting verbal and visual WM.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines 'functionally-based optimality theory' (FOT), the version of optimality theory that requires that each constraint be paired with an external functional motivation. It argues that, at least as far as syntactic constraints are concerned, FOT suffers from severe deficiencies. Such a pairing incorrectly locates the form-function interplay in the mental grammar itself, rather than seeing the response of form to function as emerging from language use and acquisition. Furthermore, FOT seems incompatible with the standard OT assumption that constraints are universal. Finally, two of the functionally-motivated hierarchies that are central to FOT theorizing, the thematic and relational hierarchies, are highly problematic, while incorporating the others into an FOT analysis leads to otherwise unnecessary complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {Event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded from 13 scalp electrodes while subjects listened to sentences containing syntactic ambiguities. Words that were inconsistent with the “preferred” sentence structure elicited a positive-going wave (the P600 effect), similar to that elicited by such words during reading (Osterhout & Holcomb, 1992). These results suggest that (1) ERPs recorded during the comprehension of spoken sentences are sensitive to the syntactic anomaly engendered by disambiguating material following erroneous analysis of a syntactically ambiguous string (the “garden-path” effect), (2) the parsing strategies employed during sentence comprehension are (in some circumstances) constant across modalities, and (3) syntactic analysis of spoken sentences is temporally close to the acoustic input.},

Whilst performance on the oral definition and sentence-to-picture matching tasks was similarly impaired, the patients performed significantly better on the sentence-to-word matching task.

  Abstract                 = {The hypothesis that categorical information, distinguishing among word classes, such as nouns, verbs, etc., is an organizational principle of lexical knowledge in the brain, is supported by the observation of aphasic subjects who are selectively impaired in the processing of nouns and verbs. The study of lesion location in these patients has suggested that the left temporal lobe plays a crucial role in processing nouns, while the left frontal lobe is necessary for verbs. To delineate the brain areas involved in the processing of different word classes, we used PET to measure regional cerebral activity during tasks requiring reading of concrete and abstract nouns and verbs for lexical decision. These tasks activated an extensive network of brain areas, mostly in the left frontal and temporal cortex, which represents the neural correlate of single word processing. Some left hemispheric areas, including the dorsolateral frontal and lateral temporal cortex, were activated only by verbs, while there were no brain areas more active in response to nouns. Furthermore, the comparison of abstract and concrete words indicated that abstract word processing was associated with selective activations (right temporal pole and amygdala, bilateral inferior frontal cortex), while no brain areas were more active in response to concrete words. There were no significant interaction effects between word class and concreteness. Taken together, these findings are compatible with the view that lexical-semantic processing of words is mediated by an extensive, predominantly left hemispheric network of brain structures. Additional brain activations appear to be related to specific semantic content, or, in the case of verbs, may be associated with the automatic access of syntactic information.}

In 3 experiments, participants named targets that were syntactically appropriate or inappropriate completions for semantically unrelated sentence contexts. Sentences ended with incomplete idioms (kick the ...) and were biased for either a literal (ball) or an idiomatic (bucket) completion. Syntactically appropriate targets were named more quickly than inappropriate ones for both contextual biases, suggesting that syntactic analysis occurs for idioms. In a final experiment, targets were either concrete (expected) or abstract (unexpected) nouns. For literal sentences, the abstract targets were named more slowly than the concrete targets. In contrast, there was no concreteness effect for idiomatic sentences, suggesting that the literal meaning of the idiom is not processed. Overall, the results provide evidence for dissociation between syntactic and semantic processing.},

is more computationally costly than parsing a syntactically transparent counterpart, a string
that provides for an interpretable representation via syntactic composition alone. The prediction of
a higher computational cost for this process is borne out by the results.},

aspectual coercion and complement coercion. These operations are characterized by being
purely semantic in nature; that is, they lack morphosyntactic reflections. Yet, the operations
are mandatory (i.e., they are indispensable for the semantic well formedness of a sentence).
Results indicate that, whereas Broca’s patients have little or no trouble understanding sentences
requiring these operations (performance was above chance for all conditions), Wernicke’s
patients performed at normal-like levels only for sentences that did not require these operations.
These findings suggest that sentence-level semantic operations rely very specifically on
the integrity of the cortical area associated with Wernicke’s aphasia, but not on the region
corresponding to Broca’s aphasia. In the context of other findings from lesion and imaging
studies, this evidence allows a view of the cortical distribution of language capacity that is
drawn along a linguistic line, one which distinguishes syntactic from semantic operations.},

We find the hypothesis problematic. It ignores the many aspects of grammar that are not recursive, such as phonology, morphology, case, agreement, and many properties of words. It is inconsistent with the anatomy and neural control of the human vocal tract. And it is weakened by experiments suggesting that speech perception cannot be reduced to primate audition, that word learning cannot be reduced to fact learning, and that at least one gene involved in speech and language was evolutionarily selected in the human lineage but is not specific to recursion. The recursion-only claim, we suggest, is motivated by Chomsky's recent approach to syntax, the Minimalist Program, which de-emphasizes the same aspects of language. The approach, however, is sufficiently problematic that it cannot be used to support claims about evolution. We contest related arguments that language is not an adaptation, namely that it is "perfect," non-redundant, unusable in any partial form, and badly designed for communication. The hypothesis that language is a complex adaptation for communication which evolved piecemeal avoids all these problems.},

Yet most research on the problem of word retrieval has focused on the production of concrete nouns, leaving open a crucial question: how is knowledge about different grammatical categories represented in the brain, and what components of the language production system make use of it? Drawing on evidence from neuropsychology, electrophysiology and neuroimaging, we argue that information about a word's grammatical category might be represented independently of its meaning at the levels of word form and morphological computation.},

Specifically, auxiliary selection is sensitive to a hierarchy of aspectual/thematic verb types: some verbs require a given auxiliary categorically, whereas others allow both auxiliaries to a greater or lesser extent depending on their position on the hierarchy. It is argued that this gradience has potentially important implications for the UNACCUSATIVE HYPOTHESIS, and more generally for theories of the lexicon-syntax interface.},

Speakers produced idioms or literal phrases (Experiment 1), completed idioms (Experiment 2), or switched between idiom completion and naming (Experiment 3). The results of Experiment 1 show that identity priming speeds up idiom production more effectively than literal phrase production, indicating a hybrid representation of idioms. In Experiment 2, we find effects of both phonological and semantic priming. Thus, elements of an idiom can not only be primed via their wordform, but also via the conceptual level. The results of Experiment 3 show that preparing the last word of an idiom primes naming of both phonologically and semantically related targets, indicating that literal word meanings become active during idiom production. The results are discussed within the framework of the hybrid model of idiom representation.},

Although previous studies have compared small samples of informal and formal results, this article presents the first large-scale comparison based on a random sample of phenomena from a leading theoretical journal (Linguistic Inquiry). We tested 296 data points from the approximately 1743 English data points that were published in Linguistic Inquiry between 2001 and 2010. We tested this sample with 936 na√Øve participants using three formal judgment tasks (magnitude estimation, 7-point Likert scale, and two-alternative forced-choice) and report five statistical analyses. The results suggest a convergence rate of 95% between informal and formal methods, with a margin of error of 5.3‚Äì5.8%. We discuss the implications of this convergence rate for the ongoing conversation about judgment collection methods, and lay out a set of questions for future research into syntactic methodology.},

Experiment 2 failed to support the claim that semantic compositionality influences the syntactic flexibility of idioms. Finally, Experiment 3 showed that idioms are more quickly recognized than their literal counterparts, regardless of compositionality and syntactic flexibility.

It follows that experience with an idiom is necessary in order to judge the acceptability of syntactic operations on that idiom. To test these claims, Experiment 1 explored the acceptability of sentences containing familiar or invented idioms in four syntactic constructions. Unlike non-native speakers, who were better with familiar than invented idioms, Italian speakers performed equally well with the two types of expressions. In Experiment 2, native speakers, unlike non-native speakers, performed equally well in judging the acceptability of idiomatic sentences, regardless of whether these were familiar or unfamiliar to them. Experiment 3 indicated that acceptability of idiom syntactic variations is not fixed; rather it increases in pragmatically appropriate contexts. Experiment 4 showed that a general rule of Italian - bare nouns cannot occur in a preverbal position - applies systematically to idioms with such nouns, blocking their use in the passive form. The results, which failed to support the superlemma hypothesis, are interpreted in light of a new hypothesis, according to which the syntax of idioms is not idiosyncratic; rather it is governed by the same syntactic and pragmatic principles that apply to literal language.},

We hypothesized that schizophrenia patients would show impaired idiom processing for literally plausible idioms (e.g., kick the bucket) but not for literally implausible idioms (e.g., be on cloud nine). Thirty-two patients and 36 controls listened to sentences containing literally plausible and implausible idioms and made lexical decisions about idiom-related or literal-related targets. Schizophrenia patients showed reduced priming for literally plausible idioms but intact priming for literally implausible idioms compared with controls. Both groups showed evidence of literal word priming. These results are consistent with the notion that schizophrenia patients make normal use of context under conditions that minimize the need for controlled processing.},

Memory & Cognition, 28(1), 28-34] to address the question of whether semantic processing abnormalities in schizophrenia arise from deficits in semantic storage or access, or the controlled use of semantic memory representations. High thought disorder schizophrenia patients (n=25), low thought disorder schizophrenia patients (n=22), and controls (n=25) read and interpreted noun-noun combinations that varied with respect to whether the modifier noun had a salient semantic feature that could be mapped to a relevant dimension of a head noun. The percentages of property attributions, relational interpretations, and "other" interpretations were determined for each combination type. Subjective difficulty ratings were also collected for each response. Neither high nor low thought disorder patients differed from controls in the production of property interpretations. High thought disorder patients were significantly less likely to generate relational interpretations and significantly more likely to generate "other" interpretations. Subjective difficulty ratings were low for all groups, suggesting that differences in the ease of generating interpretations does not account for the results. The finding of intact property interpretations suggests that the integrity and initial access of semantic memory is spared in schizophrenia. In contrast, the reduced production of relational interpretations and increased production of "other" interpretations in schizophrenia suggests a compromised ability to engage in the controlled processing operations necessary to make flexible use of semantic material.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been suggested that the processing of action-related words involves activation of the motor circuitry. Using fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), the current study further explored the interaction between action and language by investigating whether the linguistic context, in which an action word occurs, modulates motor circuitry activity related to the processing of action words. To this end, we examined whether the presentation of hand action-related verbs as positive or negative imperatives, for example, ‚ÄúDo grasp‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon't write,‚Äù modulates neural activity in the hand area of primary motor cortex (M1) or premotor cortex (Pm). Subjects (n = 19) were asked to read silently the imperative phrases, in which both meaningful action verbs and meaningless pseudo-verbs were presented, and to decide whether they made sense (lexical decision task). At the behavioral level, response times in the lexical decision task were significantly longer for negative, compared to positive, imperatives. At the neural level, activity was differentially decreased by action verbs presented as negative imperatives for the premotor and the primary motor cortex of both hemispheres. The data suggest that context (here: positive vs. negative imperatives), in which an action verb is encountered, modulates the neural activity within key areas of the motor system. The finding implies that motor simulation (or motor planning) rather than semantic processing per se may underlie previously observed motor system activation related to action verb processing. Furthermore, the current data suggest that negative imperatives may inhibit motor simulation or motor planning processes. },

In order to do so, we investigate lexical-semantic clustering properties, not only of nouns depicting objects and verbs depicting actions, but also of nouns depicting actions, which should exhibit some patterns of similarity to other nouns if grammatical class emerges on the basis of lexical semantics. We collected speaker-generated features and used self-organizing maps to model lexical-semantic similarity among words. We simulated lesions on the resulting map, finding patterns of object-noun/action-verb naming impairments consistent with those reported in the literature. Importantly, we found that action-nouns exhibited no tendency to be more similar to object-nouns than their corresponding action-verbs, a finding inconsistent with a semantic account of grammatical class.},

  Abstract                 = {Mit Hilfe von Skalpelektroden kann die elektrische Aktivit\"at von Gehirnregionen w\"ahrend der Verarbeitung von Sprache gemessen werden (Elektroenzephalogramm, EEG). F\"ur die Sprachverarbeitung ist nicht die Aktivierung engumgrenzter, unabh\"angig agierender Gehirnregionen verantwortlich, sondern die parallele Kooperation mehrerer Regionen. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der hier beschriebenen Studie die Koh\"arenz zwischen EEG-Signalen berechnet, wobei eine hohe Koh\"arenz zwischen den EEG-Signalen zweier Gehirnregionen als Ausdruck einer gesteigerten funktionellen Kooperation dieser Regionen interpretiert wird. Es wurden EEG-Koh\"arenzen von 19 Versuchspersonen berechnet, die sich akustisch pr\"asentierte Konkreta, Abstrakta und Pseudow\"orter merken sollten. Alle Aufgaben zeigten \"ahnliche Koh\"arenzmuster im Alpha-1-Band (8-10 Hz), was als Ausdruck akustisch, lexikalischer Verarbeitung der W\"orter interpretiert wurde. Das Beta-1-Band (13-18 Hz) hingegen zeigte in Abh\"angigkeit der Wortart Koh\"arenzmuster, die mit assoziativen Prozessen und komplexen kognitiven Leistungen verbunden sind. Im Sinne der heutigen Netzwerktheorien k\"onnte die Koh\"arenzanalyse des EEG in Zukunft nicht nur zum Verst\"andnis der intakten Sprachverarbeitung, sondern auch zum Verst\"andnis des Verlaufs und der R\"uckbildung von Sprachst\"orungen beitragen.},

  Abstract                 = {Extensive research into the role of saccadic eye movements in human visual perception has been carried out for many years. Although the search patterns of different observers while studying the same image bear some common characteristics, there are often variations in the temporal order in which fixation points are viewed. During visual search for a defined target, there is evidence for both parallel search, with which all objects are processed concurrently, and for sequential search, in which several fixation points are found leading to the target. In this article, we present a review of both theoretical and experimental research directed towards better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of visual search. We begin by looking at the basic dynamics of saccadic eye movements and some of the major psychophysical models that have been developed over the years. An overview of the practical applications and future trends of visual search is then provided. Visual search is a common task that people perform throughout their daily life, and the number of applications inspired by the human visual search mechanism is potentially large. The purpose of this paper is to highlight some of the key opportunities for the image and vision computing community and promote further interactions between biological and computational vision research.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of the current study was to identify the neural substrate of idiom comprehension using fMRI. Idioms are familiar, fixed expressions whose meaning is not dependent on the literal interpretation of the component words. We presented literally plausible idioms in a sentence forcing a figurative or a literal interpretation and contrasted them with sentences containing idioms for which no literal interpretation was available and with unambiguously literal sentences. The major finding of the current study is that figurative comprehension in the case of both ambiguous and unambiguous idioms is supported by bilateral inferior frontal gyri and left middle temporal gyrus. The right middle temporal gyrus is also involved, but seems to exclusively process the ambiguous idioms. Therefore, our data suggest a bilateral neural network underlying figurative comprehension, as opposed to the exclusive participation of the right hemisphere. The data also provide evidence against proposed models of idiom comprehension in which literal processing is by-passed, since figurative processing demanded more resources than literal processing in the language network.},
